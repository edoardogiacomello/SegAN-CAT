Segan_IO: SegAN model with the modified discriminator input (concatenation instead of element-wise product of MRI_in and SEG_in).
Segan_IO_Concat: Like SegAN_IO, but skip layers in generator concatenate the outputs instead of summing them.
Segan_IO_Cenc4: Like SegAN_IO, but the critic has 4 layers instead of 3


Base models are called:
{ModelName}_TF2_{dataset}_on_{modality}, which means that the model has been trained on {dataset} using only the MRI corresponding to the given modality

Transfer experiments are:

- Transfer_BratsFLAIR_disc_Bc2T1:  I took the best dice-score model for Brats FLAIR and exported the discriminator on the best dice-score model for BC2Decide T1. Discriminator has been freezed for training, except for the first 4 layers (see discriminator.layers)

- Transfer_BratsFLAIR_disc_Bc2T1-lastlayers: I took the best dice-score model for Brats FLAIR and exported the discriminator on the best dice-score model for BC2Decide T1. Discriminator has been freezed for training, except for the last 7 layers (see discriminator.layers)

- Transfer_BratsFLAIR_disc_Bc2T1-init: I took the best dice-score model for Brats FLAIR and exported the discriminator on the best dice-score model for BC2Decide T1. Discriminator has NOT been freezed for training.
